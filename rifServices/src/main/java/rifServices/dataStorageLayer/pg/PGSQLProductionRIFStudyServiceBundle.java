	 * <p>
	 * The Singleton pattern is about managing a single instance of a class.  We don't use
	 * it often in the RIF code base, but this is an example of it. All the RIF services will
	 * rely on the same collection of SQL manager classes that execute database queries. We've
	 * bundled the manager objects together into the "StudyServiceBundle", but we only want to
	 * produce one instance of it.
	 * <p> 
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Typically, Singleton code patterns are implemented to support "eager instantiation" or 
	 * "lazy instantiation".  Lazy instantiation instantiates the single instance only when it
	 * is first needed.  If the instance requires a lot of computational resources but is never
	 * used, the lazy instantiation will save the middleware from creating the object.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * With lazy instantiation, the code typically declares the single instance as a static 
	 * variable and then does an "if obj != null" check before trying to initialise it once.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Versions of the lazy instantiation singleton pattern are often prone to concurrency
	 * problems when two threads race to initialise the same instance.  One thread sees that the object
	 * is null and attempts to set it.  The second thread may also see a null object and also try to
	 * instantiate it.  
	 * </p> 
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * There are a number of ways to make lazy instantiation thread-safe.  However, here we have 
	 * avoided it by using "eager instantiation".  In this example, we declare a static variable that
	 * is set only once, when the Java class loader loads the definition of the class.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * It is simple, but has its own shortcomings which we may remedy later.  Its main weakness is that
	 * 
	 * To avoid this problem,
	 * we have used the "eager instantiation" approach, where we declare and initialise
	 * a static variable when the class is first loaded.
	 * <p>
	 * I believe this solution is thread-safe, but it has its own main weakness of not handling
	 * Exceptions.  In future, we may switch to thread-safe implementations that use
	 * lazy instantiation.  See:
	 * http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/bloch-effective-08-qa-140880.html
