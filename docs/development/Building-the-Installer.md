title: Building the RIF Installer
---

The installer (`rifInstaller.exe`, `rifInstaller_linux`, or `rifInstaller_mac`) is built from the source Python scripts using the [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) tool. Full details can be found in the [README for the `install` module](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/installer/README.rst).

Follow the instructions on that page for each platform (normally Windows, Linux, and Mac) and gather the the executables for each platform. When you are ready to create a new release, follow the GitHub steps for doing so, and upload the executables to the release when prompted to do so.
