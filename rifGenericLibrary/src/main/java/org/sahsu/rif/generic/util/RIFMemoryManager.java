 * This is a class used for memory management. For the present it only has one method: printThreadMemory()
 * It has been crrated statically as it is intended that this will run as a thread in the background

 * 'getName(...)' that is both an interface method and an accessor 
 * method, the order tells you it should appear under interface.

	/*
	 * We use eager instantiation to create a single instance of the class
	 * in a thread-safe way.  Here, RIFMemoryManager is created and assigned a value once
	 * when the class is loaded by the class loader.  It ensures that multiple threads
	 * will not each try to initialise the object.
	 * 
	 * It is more common in discussion of the Singleton pattern to use a construction that
	 * supports lazy instantiation, or instantiating RIFMemoryManager when it is needed.  There are 
	 * two reasons I don't do this.
	 * 
	 * First, we are guaranteed to need RIFMemoryManager when the RIF middleware is running.  It does not
	 * make much sense to use lazy instantiation for when you are guaranteed to need it soon after
	 * the middleware starts operating.  Second, this solution for ensuring thread safety
	 * is much simpler than the variety of solutions which are used to make lazy instantiation 
	 * thread-safe.
	 * 
	 * This solution is not perfect, and may be altered later.  Its biggest weakness is that
	 * it won't report exceptions should rifLogger fail to instantiate.
